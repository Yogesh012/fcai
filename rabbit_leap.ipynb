    "# Rabbit Leap -\n",
    "### In a rabbit leap problem, three east-bound rabbits stand in a line blocked by three west-bound rabbits. They are crossing a stream with stones placed in the east west direction in a line. There is one empty stone between them. The rabbits can only move one step or two steps. They can jump over one rabbit if need arises, but not more then that. Are they smart enough to cross each other without having to step into the waters?"
